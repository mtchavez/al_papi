        Most Effective Link Request Email\n\t\t\n\t\tBy Ben Cook on October 12, 2012
        \t\t\n\t\t\tAs soon as marketers figured out that links helped your site rank
        in Google, SEO blogs started writing posts about how to get more links.\nOver
        the years we\u2019ve burned through several link building ideas and trends
        including reciprocal linking, link wheels, widget spam, paid links and link
        networks.\nAnd, while many SEO agencies now have \u201coutreach\u201d teams
        spamming webmasters with guest posting requests, few if any agencies are using
        the most effective link request email I\u2019ve found.\nCopyright Infringement\nAs
        the son of a graphic artist and husband to a talented photographer, I\u2019ve
        become extremely (perhaps overly) sensitive to copyright infringement.\nWhile
        it may be news to many bloggers and website owners, you can\u2019t just slap
        any image you find in Google image search on your site. You also can\u2019t
        just copy and paste an entire blog post on your site for your readers to enjoy.\nContent
        and images, even those published on the web, are subject to copyright restrictions.\nAnd
        while copyright can be a pain in the neck when you\u2019re trying to find
        just the right image for your blog post, it can also be a gold mine of links
        and occasionally additional income. [Read more...]\n\t\t\n\t\tFiled Under:

        API\n\t\t\n\t\tBy Brian LaFrance on October 10, 2012 \t\t\n\t\t\tOur Partner
        API currently serves up hundreds of millions of requests per month. Not only
        are our partners, such as Raven Tools, using it, we are taking advantage of
        it for getting data into our new interface. Whether you\u2019re new to our
        Partner API or you\u2019ve been using it for a while, there\u2019s a good
        chance some of the following tips will help you get more out of our API. \nGo
        Fast\nMany people that start out on our API are afraid to POST keywords at
        full speed. I\u2019ve seen people put 30 second delays between POSTing keywords.
        The API was built to handle just about anything that can be thrown at it and
        scales to accommodate the needs of our users. The only real restrictions on
        how fast you should post are your hourly limits and how fast your servers
        can process callbacks. \nUse Custom Callback URLs\nWhen adding keywords to
        either our delayed queue or immediate queue, you have the option to send a
        custom callback URL for us to hit when we have data on that keyword. For the
        sake of improved performance and easier tracking of callbacks, we recommend
        passing a URL with an ID that matches up to an ID in your system. This can
        be a keyword ID or just a POST ID to track which callback matches which post.
        Running data at scale pretty much makes this a requirement. [Read more...]\n\t\t\n\t\tFiled

        Ben Cook on October 3, 2012 \t\t\n\t\t\t\nIt\u2019s not often we get to watch
        an extremely popular site commit SEO suicide but that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s
        going on over at Consumerist.\nOn September 20th the site was apparently hacked
        and began redirecting users off to other spam sites. As is often the case,
        the site was compromised via \u201csystems maintained by our former hosting
        provider.\u201d\nUpon discovering the hack, the website was taken down, and
        remained down for nearly a week. While site downtime isn\u2019t great for
        a site in terms of SEO, it doesn\u2019t have to be a full fledged disaster.
        In fact, the 503 HTTP result code (Service Unavailable) is made precisely
        for this kind of issue and is Google\u2019s recommendation in a situation
        like this (hat tip to John Andrews for teaching me the value of a 503 years
        ago).\nUnfortunately, it appears the Consumerist folks either don\u2019t have
        an SEO on staff, or don\u2019t have a competent one. Instead of serving up
        a 503 code while they investigated the hack, each and every single URL on
        Consumerist.com served up a 200 status code and displayed the same message
        alerting their readers to what was going on.\n [Read more...]\n\t\t\n\t\tFiled
